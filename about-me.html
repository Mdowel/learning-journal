                    <p>I'm a newcomer to the vibrant world of web development. Having previously worked in healthcare, 
                        I've embarked on an exciting journey of career change, drawn to the dynamic and creative realm of frontend 
                        development.</p>

                <strong>Combining two worlds</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                With a background in healthcare, I bring a unique perspective to my newfound passion for coding. 
                While the two fields may seem worlds apart, I've discovered surprising parallels between working 
                with medical conditions and troubleshooting code. Both require keen attention to detail, problem-solving 
                skills, and a commitment to continuous learning.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Just getting started</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                Right now, I'm diving into a self-guided course for frontend development, eager to absorb as much knowledge 
                and experience as I can. What intrigues me most about web development is the sense of puzzle-solving 
                it offers. Every line of code feels like finding a piece that fits just right, and when they all come together, 
                it's so rewarding to see something not only work, but look great too. As someone who thrives on visual feedback, 
                frontend development provides the perfect blend of creativity and technicality.  I find great satisfaction in 
                crafting user interfaces and bringing designs to life, knowing that every line of code contributes to a seamless 
                and engaging web experience.
                <br>
                <br>
                In this new chapter of my professional journey, I'm excited to combine my background in healthcare with my 
                burgeoning skills in web development, striving to create meaningful and impactful solutions that improve people's 
                lives in the digital sphere. I'm ready to make a positive mark in the ever-evolving world of technology!

                    <h3>Breaking Ground: My First Frontend Ventures</h3>
                    <p>From crafting secure passwords to bringing the buzz of live music to life on a webpage, each project taught 
                        me valuable lessons. Through these projects, I discovered the joy of turning ideas into reality with code 
                        and the endless possibilities that lie ahead in my coding journey.
